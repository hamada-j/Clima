# Clima

build a Full-Stack web app to calc all numeric params in a list. User will be able to see all previous queries too.

## Requirements:

- An endpoint /calc that receives an undetermined number of arguments and returns the sum of those arguments that are numerical (you could receive different types of data).
- A second endpoint /history that returns all previous calls to /calc.
- A form view to add several values (one per field, no limit), send them to /calc endpoint and, then, show the result.
- A list view with all previous queries.
